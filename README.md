## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install.

2. Run `yarn start` to start the application. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`.

## Goals

- [x] Develop some way to visualize the mock data easily (Table, List, Etc...).
- [x] Your solution showcases your CSS styling skills.

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Calculate a fund's multiple (Hint: This calculation is derived from the `impliedValue` and `cost` data points in the mocks).
- [x] Implement some type of routing solution to view a specific fund/company data.
- [x] We are starting to use visualizations to show this type of data in our real product.
      It would be cool to see you implement some visualizations from the mock data provided.
- [x] Modify/Add to the mock data to create a more interesting/rich experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The code is well organized.
- [x] The code follows React/JavaScript best practices.
- [x] The code has good test coverage.
- [x] Your Git commit history is clean and meaningful.
